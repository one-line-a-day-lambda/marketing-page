                        <p>There's a unique relationship between the hand and brain, sparked by the composition of thoughts and
                            ideas. Words are representations of ideas; the formation of letters and causes the mind to compose
                            or re-compose ideas while journaling. This bolsters previously covered information and forces you to
                            engage in cognitive recall.</p>

                        <p>Journaling often includes your dreams and ambitions, yet the idea that scribbled words can help
                            achieve goals is understandably fanciful. But consider building a house without a blueprint. That
                            makes more sense. Writing goals signals to your brain "this is important." Use One Line a Day to
                            write down goals for each day!</p>

                        <p>Journaling is an exploration of language, you'll have the natural urge to search for new words and
                            increase your vocabulary. The report goes on to say, "One of the best single measures of overall
                            intelligence as measured by intelligence tests is vocabulary."</p>

                        <p>Setting time aside to write, whether morning or evening, is an act of discipline. And discipline
                            begets discipline. Like a muscle, the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes. And habits
                            formed in one area of life have a tendency to spread; as keeping your office clean leads to keeping
                            the bedroom tidy,your daily practice of writing will domino onto other healthy habits.</p>
